- Laro, the player, needs your help in collecting all the mushrooms scattered everywhere!
- Collect all the mushrooms to win the game.
- *complete levels in as few moves as possible (leaderboard bonus feature?)
- Be careful to not fall into the water; he would die and lose the quest!
- Push rocks to remove pitfalls!
- Items, like axes and flamethrowers can open pathways as well!

# Controls:
- Use WASD keys to move the player. (obviously!)
- Other than that, use P to pick up an item (when standing on it)
- When the game is lost or won, you can press ! to reset the level!
- Finally, type 'q' to exit the game!

Controls apply once [Enter] is pressed. 
You can type a string of moves then press [Enter] to execute them in one go.

# Items
Axe: walk into a tree to cut it down. Clears the tree's tile.
Flamethrower: walk into a tree to burn it and start a forest fire.
