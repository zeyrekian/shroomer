# How do you play Shroom Raiders
- collect mushrooms to beat a level
- *complete levels in as few moves as possible (leaderboard bonus feature?)
- don't fall into water; doing so causes you to fail the level
- push rocks onto water to pave the way
- pick up items such as axes and flamethrowers to clear trees and find solutions

# Basic controls
[WASD] Move the player. Push rocks onto free tiles.
*see alternate move keys
[P] Go onto a tile with an item to pick it up. 
Item effects apply on their own. You cannot drop items once picked up.
Mushrooms are picked up upon moving to their tiles.
[!] Reset the level.

Controls apply once [Enter] is pressed. 
You can type a string of moves then press [Enter] to execute them in one go.

# Items
Axe: walk into a tree to cut it down. Clears the tree's tile.
Flamethrower: walk into a tree to burn it and start a forest fire. 
Burning trees will burn trees touching it and clear their tiles.
